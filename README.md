Self Assessment

Functionality - 3 - Both encrypt and decrypt methods are successful and can be implemented from the command line.
OOP - 3 - Project broken down into two classes.  One that generates the key and another that actually does the encryption/decryption.
Ruby Convention - 3 - Class, methods and variables follow ruby convention. Some enumerables were used including some that I haven't used before(each_with_index for example). At least one hash was implemented.
TDD - 3 - Every method is being tested and has a coverage of 100% through SimpleCov. Stubbs are being used to test methods that generate random numbers. Git workflow was implemented with several branches merged back in using pull requests. Tests were primarily developed before class methods.
